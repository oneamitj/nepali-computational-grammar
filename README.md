DISCLAIMER
==========

I don't own this project or have any involvment in development process. I used this during my compilation of [SentiWordNetNep](https://github.com/wannamit/nep-SentiWord-py) and found it to be very useful resource for Nepali NLP works.

Recently I find out, it is very hard to find this project's resource online. This is the reason I am sharing what I have, so that other can use and develop awesome tools for Nepali language.
